# Investigating Series – Research and Trading Ideas

This repository contains code, data, and notebooks supporting the **Investigating Series**, a blog-based initiative where I explore financial markets through data analysis, modeling, and strategy development.

Each analysis focuses on a specific topic — from volatility decomposition and return dynamics to signal testing and portfolio behavior — with an emphasis on connecting theory to practical application.

## 📚 About the Series

The **Investigating Series** is published on my personal blog, where I share exploratory research on:

- Market structure and behavior
- Historical return patterns
- Volatility modeling
- Signal-based strategies
- Risk and performance analysis
- Other ideas that emerge from curiosity and reading

The content is meant to be hands-on and transparent: each post is backed by open-source code that allows you to reproduce the results and extend the analysis.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a specific investigation or topic discussed in the blog.

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `vale3_volatility_decomposition` | Decomposing historical volatility of VALE3 and building a trading model based on intraday/overnight return correlations. |
| `...` | New studies and strategy prototypes will be added continuously. |

## 🧰 Tools and Dependencies

The code is primarily written in **Python**, and makes use of libraries such as:

- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn` — data handling and visualization
- `yfinance` — financial data download
- `QuantStats` — performance evaluation
- `scipy`, `statsmodels`, etc. — statistical tools where needed

Some notebooks may require additional dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt`.
